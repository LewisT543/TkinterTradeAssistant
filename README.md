# Tkinter Trade Database GUI

This project is a work in progress!
Currently this project is a graphical user interface built with Tkinter, with a SQLite database attatched to the backend.

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple one-stop-shop helper for traders. 
Currently the features are as follows:
- A database in which to store trades;
- An interface allowing for new trades to be added to the database;
- A table to display all trades recorded so far;
- A position size calculator;
- A notepad for quickly jotting down notes.

Features to be implemented:
- Different pre-defined search parameters for the database (show last 7days trades, show all BTC pair trades, etc...);
- A place to store strategies and their paramaters;
- (MAYBE) Implement backtesting capability and visualisation.
